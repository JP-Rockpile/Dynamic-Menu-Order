# Dynamic-Menu-Order

Restaurants are constantly changing and updating their menus. Having an employee
contact a web developer and having them update the website to properly reflect the
current menu may be time intensive and expensive. Otherwise you may need a
restaurant employee who knows how to update the website. Instead it is best to have
the restaurant website pull from a secondary system and dynamically populate the
website to maintain formatting and function. 

The javascript in the attached file creates the entire menu dynamically with a
corresponding hierarchy. It pulls the data from a separate php site that could easily be
updated with different information and prices, yet the hierarchy and functionality of the
code would remain.

The next step for this is to apply more CSS styling.
Additionally after hitting view order the JSON data can be displayed more readable.
